This project delves into the dynamic Airbnb market in New York City, examining trends, pricing dynamics, and factors that impact listing popularity.
Through data science techniques and visualizations, our goal is to uncover insights into host and guest behaviors in one of the world's most dynamic hospitality markets.
  
# 2)[Word Frequency Classic Novels](https://github.com/3mralaa159/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Word%20Frequency%20Classic%20Novels)
In this project, I analyzed the word frequencies of classic novels using Python programming language.
The goal was to gain insights into the most frequently used words in these literary works, offering a deeper understanding of their themes and styles.
## Questions:
- What are the most frequent words in Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick and how often do they occur?
## ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
- Implemented text processing techniques to tokenize and clean the text data.
- Utilized Python libraries requests \ BeautifulSoup to extract \ edit online files
- Utilized Python libraries such as NLTK and Seaborn for natural language processing and visualization.
- Generated visualizations like bar plots to display the top words and their frequencies.
- Applied basic statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from the data.
